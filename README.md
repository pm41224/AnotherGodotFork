# Another Godot Fork

The name of this fork is exactly what it says on the tin.

I made this fork (a) for archival purposes and (b) for future modding. The name is temporary until I can come up with a better name and when I actually start modifying the code. In the meantime, the code is presented as-is.

## 2D and 3D cross-platform game engine

**Another Godot Fork ("AGF") is a feature-packed, cross-platform game engine to create 2D and 3D games from a unified interface.** It provides a comprehensive set of common tools, so that
users can focus on making games without having to reinvent the wheel. Games can be exported with one click to a number of platforms, including the major desktop platforms (Linux, macOS, Windows), mobile platforms (Android, iOS), as well as Web-based platforms and consoles.

## Free, open source and community-driven

AGF is completely free and open source under the very permissive MIT license. No strings attached, no royalties, nothing. The users' games are theirs, down to the last line of engine code. AGF's development is fully independent and community-driven, empowering users to help shape their engine to match their expectations. It is supported by the community not-for-profit.

Before being open sourced in February 2014, Godot had been developed by Juan Linietsky and Ariel Manzur (both still maintaining the original Godot project) for several years as an in-house engine, used to publish several work-for-hire titles.

## Getting the engine

AGF is not only an engine but an ever-growing community of users and engine developers.
